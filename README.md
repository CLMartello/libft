2. Creation of string manipulation functions.
3. Creation of memory manipulation functions.
4. Creation of linked list manipulation functions as bonus part.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Command "make" to create archive file.
3. Develop main() and compile using gcc.
4. Test different functions and compare with original ones.
